# blog-project
This is a full stack MERN application that is 80% complete. The full version is not deployed currently as there is still login information for my MongoDB cluster in the server folder. 

This application currently allows you to create new blog posts, which include a title, content, and a picture that can be uploaded from your computer. I am currently putting the final touches on the edit and delete functionality, and the final thing to complete will be the login functionality.
