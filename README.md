# blog-project
This is a full stack MERN application that is over 80% complete. The full version is not deployed currently as there is still login information for my MongoDB cluster in the server folder. 

This application currently allows you to create new blog posts, which include a title, content, and a picture that can be uploaded from your computer. Users can edit the post title and content, and delete posts. I am currently finishing with the login functionality and it will be ready for deployment
